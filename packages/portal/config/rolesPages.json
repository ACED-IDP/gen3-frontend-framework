As an example, the prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) is an electronic database that tracks controlled substance prescriptions in a state to improve opioid prescribing, inform clinical practice, and protect patients at risk. Such implementations will be most effective if states effectuate policies that require providers to a state PDMP prior to prescribing certain controlled substances. The Gen3 Platform shares research about new and innovative implementations and other useful datasets that inform evidence-based decisions on state policies.
